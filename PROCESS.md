# day 1
Since I thought that making a prototype was going to be tough, I already started on the board in the weekend. This days deadline was for a proposal however so I began to write that. Now with it finished, I am going to focus on the prototype again.
# day 2
The visual representation of the board is finished, but I am having a hard time actually placing pieces on it. It might be better to have actual individual tiles placed in a gridlayout that handle their own colour and occupation rather than having a custom gridview with tiles drawn on it which nevertheless returns proper coordinates.
What I really want to do is retain my custom gridview and have an imageview of a piece inflate into it. It is a challenge, because I haven't started on the engine yet and that will be where piece coordinates come from. I have created a position converter in case I want to implement a one-dimensional board on engine level and a two-dimensional board on GUI level. I have created a Piece class and a Knight class that extends Piece. After all I want to place some pieces on the board. I do think that the current state of the prototype is sufficient. 
# day 3
Tried to build a board made of individual tiles today. Not a success. Yet. The board doesn't display. Should be at this point all be black tiles, but is empty gridlayout.
I think that I am going to focus on the engine from now on, no point in making a GUI for a facade. It might be best to give pieces two-dimensional coordinates.
